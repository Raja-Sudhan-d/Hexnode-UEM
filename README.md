# Hexnode Website Design Recreation  

This project is a re-creation of the **Hexnode** website design using **HTML**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap**, and **JavaScript**. 
The focus was on building a visually appealing, responsive, and user-friendly design for most devices, divided into sections with unique IDs for better navigation.

## Technologies Used  
- **HTML**: For structuring the content of the website.  
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.  
- **Bootstrap**: To enhance responsiveness and use pre-designed components.  
- **JavaScript**: For interactive features and dynamic behavior.  

## Features  
- Responsive design compatible with most devices.  
- Clean and structured code for better readability and maintenance.  
- Divided into multiple sections using IDs for easy navigation.  

## Instructions for Running the Project  
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/Raja-Sudhan-d/Hexnode-UEM

## Approach:
The design was divided into well-defined sections, each with a unique ID, to facilitate easier navigation and styling.
Used a mobile-first design approach to ensure responsiveness across various screen sizes.
Leveraged Bootstrap classes to simplify layouts and speed up development.
JavaScript was incorporated to enhance interactivity where required.

## Challenges Faced

**Responsiveness**:
Ensuring the website maintained its visual integrity across a wide range of devices required multiple iterations of layout adjustments and testing.

**Alignment Issues**:
Aligning content and images, especially in complex sections, was tricky due to variations in screen sizes and required detailed CSS tweaks.

**Bootstrap Overrides**:
While Bootstrap provided a strong foundation, some default styles had to be overridden with custom CSS to match the original Hexnode design.


**Notes**
This project is a static re-creation of the Hexnode website. It does not include back-end functionality.
The design and layout are based on the appearance of the Hexnode website at the time of this project's creation.
